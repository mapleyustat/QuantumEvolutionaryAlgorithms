    "## Part 2: QEA\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional k-means clustering algorithm has two shortcomings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering outcome is sensitive to the randomly initialized centroids and this may lead the algorithm converge to the local optima.\n",
    "1. Value of k has to be known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution to 1: Use genetic algorithms\n",
    "Initialize a population of centroids and allow it to be learnt over many generations through selection, crossover and mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution to 2: Use qubits to represent genes\n",
    "1. Representing gene pattern with qubits allows us to represent more patterns simultaneously. This introduces some randomness and makes the centroids less sensitive to initial values.\n",
    "1. Moreover, this allows us for **variable encoding** of the genes. This prevents us from having to guess the initial value of k that can be learnt in the evolutionary process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other design choices\n",
    "1. Use Eucledian distance & Davies-Bouldin rule index to calculate the fitness of an individual.\n",
    "2. Roulette selection and elite selection\n",
    "3. Crossover operation can change the length of the chromosomes\n",
    "4. Mutation uses pauli_x_gate and **rotates the qubit** in the direction of higher fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training\n",
    "Simulated dataset with 8 clusters and 800 samples. Notice that the value of k is varying during training. This took approximately 13 hours.\n",

    "2. Mitigate outliers in dataset (K-median, weighted data points)\n",
    "3. Explore deeply about other quantum gates"
